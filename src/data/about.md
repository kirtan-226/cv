# Intro

Hello! I’m Kirtan J. Limbachiya—a curious mind passionate about technology, learning, and impact. My journey in tech started with a fascination for problem-solving and evolved through hands-on experience in software development, data science, and leadership. I've worked on diverse projects involving technologies like React, Node.js, and CodeIgniter, and led teams during internships where we delivered robust backend systems.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master's in Digital Engineering in Germany, with a special interest in data engineering and intelligent systems. My academic path has been shaped by a desire to innovate and continuously grow as both a developer and a collaborator.

Outside of tech, I find joy in community service through BAPS and have led initiatives like the Unnat Bharat Clean Drive in Bharuch. I also enjoy chess, which sharpens my strategic thinking—something I bring into my coding and team efforts. My mission is to use technology for good—solving real-world problems with precision, empathy, and purpose.
